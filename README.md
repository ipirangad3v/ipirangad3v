🤓 **A little more about me:**

Along with my knowledge of kotlin and Android, I apply clean code concepts, S.O.L.I.D. and architectures like MVP and MVVM. Also, I love the concepts of clean architecture and I always apply it in my projects.

I'm currently learning mobile development with flutter framework and dart language in addition to IOS development with swift.

  I've worked as technical support, network analysis and today I'm facing the challenge of being a programmer. I started in the world of programming with self-taught Java and C++ at the university and with them I learned several concepts of programming logic, OOP and functional programming.
